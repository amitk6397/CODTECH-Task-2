Overview of the Student Grade Tracker Project

Project Purpose

The Student Grade Tracker project is designed to help users manage and track student grades for various subjects or assignments. It provides a straightforward way to input grades, calculate averages, and display overall performance metrics, including letter grades and GPA. This project aims to enhance understanding of data handling, calculations, and user interaction in Java.

Key Features

Grade Input: Users can input multiple grades for different subjects or assignments.
Average Calculation: The program calculates the average of the entered grades.
Letter Grade Calculation: Based on the average, it determines the corresponding letter grade.
GPA Calculation: Optionally, the program can compute a simple GPA based on the average (using a standard scale).
User-Friendly Interface: Clear prompts guide the user through the process of entering grades and receiving feedback on performance.

Project Structure

Main Class: The StudentGradeTracker class contains the main method and the logic for grade management.
Data Storage: Uses a list to store the grades entered by the user.
Methods:
addGrade(double grade): Adds a new grade to the list.
calculateAverage(): Computes the average of the stored grades.
getLetterGrade(double average): Determines the letter grade based on the average.

User Interaction Flow

The program starts and welcomes the user.
The user is prompted to enter grades one at a time.
The user can indicate when they are finished entering grades (e.g., by typing "exit").
After all grades are entered, the program calculates the average and the letter grade.
The results are displayed to the user, including the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
The program terminates.

Conclusion

The Student Grade Tracker project provides a practical tool for managing student grades, allowing users to gain insight into their academic performance. It serves as a useful exercise in Java programming, focusing on data structures, input handling, calculations, and user interactions. The program can be further enhanced with additional features, such as support for multiple subjects or saving grades to a file for persistent storage.
